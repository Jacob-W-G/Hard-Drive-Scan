# Hard-Drive-Scan

There was a few hard drives that needed to be checked to find if there was any info that was needed to be saved.


I started of by getting these hard drives by removing them from the computer

After these drives were recieved I plugged them into a adapter so I can scan the drive.

Once the hard drives were plugged into the adapter I loaded up the software named "Autopsy" so the drives are able to be scanned.

After the info was sent into the software so the files are orgonized the scan has started.

Depending on how much is stored on the drive the process can take 7 minutes up to multipule hours.

When the drives are scanned I searched through them to look if there was anything needing to be saved.

After the search there was nothing found on both drives that was needed to be saved.

When I was done the hard drives were unplugged and waiting for what will happen next but most likely the drives will be wiped.
